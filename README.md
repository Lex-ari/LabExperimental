# LabExperimental
## A project designed around creating a Virtual Reality chemistry lab in Unity!

Currently a WIP, features are still being implemented!

Started this project mid-July 2022 after I completed all of Unity's official pathways including Essentialls, Junior Programmer, and VR development.

Also learned how to use basic Blender tools to model objects.

Current Features:
- Glass Beakers can contain "water"
- Liquid physics!
  - They swish when their container is moved.
  - Tilting the container "pours" the liquid out of the container, creating a stream.
  - Depending on if there's another container below the stream, it can create a puddle.
- Bunsen Burner
  - When a container with a liquid is put above an active Bunsen Burner, the liquid is heated up and starts boiling.

Features to be Implemented:
 - VR grabbable interactions
 - Erlenmeyer Flask
 - Spherical Flask
 - More accurate rendering of liquid inside of containers
 - More accurate thermodynamics
 - Coffee Mug
